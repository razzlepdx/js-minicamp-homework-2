# Homework #2

## Instructions
---
1. Feynman Writing Prompts - Write out explanations of the following concepts like you are explaining it to a 12 year old.  Doing this will help you quickly discover any holes in your understanding.  Ask your questions on Slack.

	* for loop - a for loop performs the same task over and over again, and stops only when a certain condition or scenario is met.  For example, if I had a list of the names of my pets, I could use a for loop to go through the list one by one, and count how many pets had names that began with the letter 'm'.  Once the for loop got to the last name in the list, it would stop.   Or, I could set the for loop to say "Hello" 20 times - after the 20th time, it would (finally) stop.  
	* && || ! - `&&` = and, `||` = or, and `!` = not.  These are used when comparing items or conditions - usually to determine a "true" or "false" value.
	* Array - this is basically a list or group of things you want to keep together - it can be a list of numbers, words, sentences, or more complicated items (like a customer's name, address, phone number, and next appointment date).
	* git - version control software.  It saves working copies and changes on the same program or document.  It allows one or many people to see what changes have been made, and to make sure that everyone is on the most up to date changes.
	* GitHub - it's an online cloud storage platform for people to share and store coding projects and other documents.
